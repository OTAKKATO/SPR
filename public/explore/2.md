##### How to make sure my game is not spying on me
If the app is free, the developer still needs to make money somehow. They do that by selling your data for targeted advertising.

Before downloading any app, check the permissions and see if you can run it without giving it any of the permissions it needs to track your data.

##### How to stay safe
- Check the reviews. Your phone security and privacy is the most important thing – know what you’re downloading. Have a look at multiple sources to see if an app can be trusted with your private details.
- Pay attention to permissions. Be wary if an app asks for permissions it shouldn’t need to function. No flashlight app needs to know your location.
- Update the apps you use and delete the ones you don’t. Your phone probably has too many apps. Deleting the ones you don’t use will optimize your phone's performance and protect you from potential vulnerabilities. Updating the ones you use will help keep them secure.
- Review your apps permissions weekly and delete those who have a lot of permissions.
- Use a VPN. With a VPN app, every connection your device makes online will be encrypted, which includes your apps.
- Turn off your phone when unused.
- Use an anti virus.
- Block your camera when not used. I recommend [Microphone Blocker & Guard](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.protectstar.microguardfree)
